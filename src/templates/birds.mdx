Birds.  We all know them, for good or for bad, and chances are you've seen one recently.  Perhaps perched on a tree or congregating
in crowds to peck at breadcrumbs, or even in your fast food drive-thru order.

You've probably never paid much attention to them, they appear to be ornaments in the unending slog of life, just mere props in the heroic opera of human history.
In that case, you thought wrong! I'm here to rip open the curtains and shatter the illusion.  There are no crickets in Wayward Pines!
Like every other species, birds fit together in ecosystems like the infamous <HoverImage src="https://i.imgur.com/llHAvNv.jpg">missing piece</HoverImage> from your 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.
If KFC becomes too <HoverImage src="https://i.imgur.com/NrUN8Rj.jpg">overzealous</HoverImage> and afterwards an alarmingly sharp decline in bird populations is noted, we might just be in trouble!

In today's e̶p̶i̶s̶o̶d̶e̶ blogpost, we'll figure out what birds are, why certain kinds bob up and down like a jackhammer, and if they really exist**.

To answer these <HoverImage src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1f677e5292a7a6fd615f37d6322ca071/tumblr_p370mdtpj51x3govlo1_250.gifv">burning</HoverImage> questions, we first have to look at the origins of birds.

<p class="no-mb">A long time ago in a continent not so far away...</p>

## The Dawn of the Squawk
6.78024e+15 seconds ago*** on the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea, (The continent in question gets its name from the because it flopped over the mantle like a pancake)
the great-great-great-great(repeat this times a few million)-grandparents of modern-day birds were eking out a living as vicious airborne hunters of small, defenseless prey.

![the fierce pteronodon](https://i.imgur.com/GN9T9l3.jpg)

The impressive ancestors of the pigeon crapping on your front porch were known as pterosaurs.   They could appear
quite <HoverImage src="https://i.imgur.com/6Nn4ucD.gif">menacing</HoverImage> up close, and rightly so! They were absolutely <HoverImage src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FJHCgb2Pwk8qNgcnd6QBe3-320-80.jpg">ginormous.</HoverImage>

Pterosaurs in themselves were prone to having weird proportions, with most of their body consisting of necc.  Some species were so odd they looked like a <HoverImage src="https://i.imgur.com/BbnXQb3.jpg">reverse homunculus.</HoverImage>
A prime example being the long-gone species Quetzalcoatlus, which is not a mexican name for a dish made of duffel coat shavings.

![quetzalcoatlus proportions](https://i.imgur.com/4VIBPF5.gif)

Looking at the image above, we can see that someone accidentally added a few zeroes to the neck-to-body ratio.
Why evolution did this, we can only assume. Perhaps [insert sky deity here] was having a slow day and made a Quenyangoatbus for shits and giggles.

Not every pterosaur made it into the final product we see today.  When an unreasonably large chunk of rock smacked the Earth 66 million years ago,
75% of all living creatures didn't make it.
Quinoafloatmust went with that 75% into the ether, never to be seen again but for a few lonely fossils.

## What? AERODACTYL is evolving!

<!-- This event marks two separate periods of time, BA (Before Asteroid) and AA (After Asteroid). -->
A few small pterosaurs managed to survive the aftermath, and in time became birds.
Their teeth were fused into their jaw to become keratinous beaks****, and gizzards applied (and were accepted) for the job of chief food masticator.
Gizzards are an new evolutionary plaything that, in a rather <HoverImage src="https://i.imgur.com/BAwHwq1.jpg">big brain</HoverImage> move,
uses stones the bird swallows to help grind up food.  (It should be noted that #NotAllBirds use swallowed bits of gravel to grind up food)

As the birds diversified, new species formed.  They vary in size from tiny hummingbirds to flightless ostriches.
(<span style="color: #d08770; font-weight: 700">Fun Fact:</span> Ostrich Omelettes are a South African dish for hangovers. One ostrich egg is equivalent to 24 chicken eggs, so it's good to prepare for a large party)
The smaller the birds got, the easier prey they became.  The midget birds responded by being speedy, with metabolisms
faster than the predator pursuing them.  But with great speed comes great responsibility.  Though it might not look like it,
your cousin's late pet budgie (protip: don't leave birds alone with wry cats) can poop up to 50 times a day!
Foot-dagger-equipped <HoverImage src="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Images/cassowary-side_tcm25-568936.jpg">cassowaries</HoverImage> can't beat that, despite their impressive size.


## Basic Biology
When genetics visits the Build-A-Bird Workshop, it goes through **seven simple steps** to create a brand-new bird:

<p class="no-mb"><strong>Choose Me:</strong> It choose the species of bird — from a tiny hummingbird to a bulky ostrich and a preening peacock to a seafaring seagull.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Hear Me:</strong> It adds a certain set of sounds to the bird's voice box.*****</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Stuff Me:</strong> It begins to fill the bird template with specific organs, bones and muscles.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Hug Me:</strong> It gives it a squeeze to gauge the robustness of the skeletal structure and musculature.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Dress Me:</strong> Genetics applies external features such as beaks, feathers and wings to the part-sockets.</p>
<p class="no-mb"><strong>Name Me:</strong> Genetics leaves the name blank.  In a few million years, another simian species will do the naming for it.</p>
<p><strong>Take Me Home:</strong> The newly created bird hatches from its mothers egg, and becomes yet another player in the Game of Life.</p>

All bird species share certain traits.  Feathers, wings, beaks, and the ability to lay eggs.  Most birds also have hollow bones (to be light enough to fly),
with the exception of flightless birds.  (In the frigid deserts of the Antarctic, penguins have thicc bones with marrow that functions similar to antifreeze.
Ostriches, too, have thicc, hefty bones.  They're capable of delivering nasty bonks to ne'er-do-wells)

To determine if any questionable creature is a bird or not, run through the trait checklist.
The animal in question should have at least two of the features listed.

Feeling inadequate about your <HoverImage src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-12/ea006b50-26ba-11ea-9ed7-dae4293d4607">paunch?</HoverImage> You better hit the gym, because a (flighted) birds' chest muscles make up 15-25% of its body weight!

<!-- All species of birds share certain features, for instance wings and beaks. (flightless birds still come equipped with wings, despite how useless they may be)
They are bipedal, usually have necks (a notable exception being your delightfully golden-brown and plump rotisserie chicken dripping with bird juices that you prepared in your brand-new toaster oven)
and are almost always absolutely *shredded*.  A birds' chest muscles (pectorals) control the wings and make up 15-25% of a flighted bird's body weight.

But not all birds are created equal. There will be the top dogs that hunt and fear (mostly) no animal.  These are the birds of prey, a counterintuitive name for
a predator considering they aren't the prey.  (They are also known as raptors, a throwback to the velociraptors in the Cretaceous period)
Then there are less well-endowed birds such as sparrows**** and finches.  They might be a beetle's worst enemy, but hungry falcons don't discriminate. -->


<!-- The mighty eagle is master to no one and has first choice of picking fresh prey, its claws wide open, ready
to snatch the unwitting victim and fly back to the nest.  
The scrawny vulture is a scavenger who profits off the spoils of others.  When one observant vulture spies a predator having its lunch, the skies above are thronged with
them
 they ravenously feast on the scraps from the carnage when the killers have left.
Songbirds are small and slight, with melodic voices.  They provide sadistic amusement for the average housecat, fat and complacent.

The scrawny vulture relies on
other predators to fish out prey for them, and the skies above are thronged with them, waiting for the predator to leave, to flood in and fight
amongst one another for the scraps. -->

Peacocks are among the more ornate of birds.  In the case of males, their feathers are furnished with colorful patterns in order to woo a female he fancies.
Female birds have it good when it comes to the choice of a mate, as during mating season there will typically be many males lined up.

<p class="no-mb">Owls are unique among their winged compatriots for having eyes so large that they aren't eye balls but elongated tubes, known as eye tubes
(it adorns them with a rather intimidating stare).
They're held in place by a bony structure called the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sclerotic_ring">Sclerotic ring</a>.
Mrs. Hoot compensates for this by having a noteworthy range of rotation in her neck.  If Mrs. Hoot's mischievous owlet behind her is
stealing beetles from the beetle jar, she can easily rotate her head 270 degrees and catch the thief red-handed!</p>
Despite an owl's looks, they are actually vicious carnivores that have no qualms eating their pint-sized winged brethren.

A certain species of owl, the Barn Owl, has a terrifying demonic banshee hiss-screech straight from the 7th circle of Hell.
I don't know about you, but if I saw this, you can bet good money I'd get the hell out of there ASAP and maybe call a local exorcist.

Woodpeckers are known for drilling into tree bark with their beaks to harvest tasty tree-dwelling insects.  When the beak pokes through the
rough outer bark, a subterranean cave (or rather, bark) system is exposed, carved into the very flesh of the tree by the invertebrates
living in it.  These tunnels are narrow and can be quite long and winding.  To leap over this obstacle, Woodpeckers evolved
long, flexible barbed tongues capable of dislodging ants and larvae from deep crevices.
But the question remains, how does a tongue that long fit in a woodpecker's head?  Perhaps it could:
<!-- have an interesting adaptation -->

<!-- having eye tubes in lieu of sockets, -->




### Telomere Time at 4 o'clock
Unlike us humans, bird chromosomes are reversed.  Female birds have a single Z and W chromosome and the males have two Zs.
Similar to a human Y chromosome, the W is substantially smaller than the Z (or X) chromosome, a deficient knockoff.

## The Dangerzone

While your average pigeon isn't going to commit grievous bodily harm to you, the same can't be said for other birbs.
The most deadly bird is the Cassowary. It's the second largest bird in the world (just beaten by ostriches, whose omelettes are supreme)
As per its name, cassowaries are rather wary of humans, and come equipped with foot-daggers to rend the organs of the unfortunate soul who dares come close.
and its eggs range in hue from the color of <HoverImage src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/cb/ac/22cbacdb6376ccfa9fe683b10cc1560f.jpg">unripe mangoes</HoverImage> to really big limes.  If you encounter one, fend it off with a hefty rake.  Its secret weapon is
the reptilian dinosaur-like claws on its feet.
You might not die from its attack, but you're bound to rupture a few organs.

<p class="no-mb">A quote from Ernest Thomas Gilliard's 1958 book, <em>Living Birds of the World</em>:</p>

> The inner or second of the three toes is fitted with a long, straight, murderous nail which can sever an arm or eviscerate an abdomen with ease. There are many records of natives being killed by this bird.

Note: Cassowaries are a protected species, don't try to harvest cassowary steaks.

The study of birbs is called Ornithology, because people who study birds are ornery.

<!-- To answer these burning questions, we have to rip a gash in space-time and steal a TARDIS.
From there, we can dial back the timeometer and go back 200 million years, to the age of the dinosaur. If you think that seems like an
excessive amount of time, keep in mind that it's only twice as long as the time it takes to pass
a law in Congress.

If you don't see any pterodactyls, you may be on the wrong continent. In that case, travel back
to the present and board a plane to the appropriate landmass (you may have to pay extra for the TARDIS luggage costs) -->

<!-- These creatures were not the ancestors of all varieties of birbs on this planet. If you look closely, you may find a resemblance between the two. -->
<!-- Contrary to popular belief, the dinosaurs who took to the skies were not the ancestors of modern-day birbs.
When a large asteroid 66 million years ago decided to mess with future archeologists by wiping out three-quarters of all life on Earth,
pterodactyls went with them into the ether. (The collision's shockwave precipitated wildfires that tore through the habitats of tree-dwelling animals)
The surviving proto-birds were most likely the great-great-great(multiply this times a few million)-grandparents of chickens.

We can test this theory by re-entering our blue phone booth and proceeding forward to a few thousand years after the asteroid struck.

The millions of years of breeding and mutating have created fanciful adaptations, from the head-bobbing pigeons thirsty for bread to the swooping seagulls also thirsty for bread.
