When I was hosting my Minecraft Server on an pay-per-month VM, I was faced with shelling over a 
non-unsubstantial sum of money each month for eight gigs of RAM. For most peons and commonfolk who
play on the default version of the game, that's enough for twenty players. (provided someone doesn't tank 
the server with their chicken farm that's a billion members strong) But for the enlightened intellectuals
that indulge in the wild west of modded minecraft (especially heavily modded, I'm talking 150 mods upwards),
it leaves the host machine begging for spare RAM.

With my wallet taking a monthly beating and the server players facing frequent crashes and lag spikes, I knew
it was time for a better investment.  Goodbye, DigitalOcean, and hello home server!

**NOTE:** If you're here for a recommendation by a "professional", good luck finding one here. I make no claim of expertise,
just personal experience.

## But Which PC is the right one?
My main requirements for a PC were:
- It has to be fun-sized
- It must be as silent as a bacterium
<!-- - It shouldn't <HoverImage src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/M1-Mac-Mini-7.jpg?">break the bank</HoverImage> -->
- It shouldn't <HoverImage src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/M1-Mac-Mini-7.jpg?">plunge me into impecuniousness</HoverImage>
- Ready to Use? get that out of my keratinocytes!

- It requires <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgowBLb4sKw" target="_blank">customizability</a> (Gib RAM pls ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§)
With these specific parameters, I could start excluding potential candidates.

Raspberry PIs aren't known for being the powerhouses of mini PCs, and aren't upgradable.
It's a shame, but I prefer cherry pies ü•ß

The Mac Mini got decent reviews, but as with all of Apple's products, it will put a painful dent in your bank balance, and come with
a disappointing number of ports.

Pushing the size of PCs to the absolute limit, PC Sticks are the smallest ones on the market.  Unfortunately, with less size comes
less power.

After some research,
I settled on an Infidel NUC, which is pronounced a certain way but I won't tell you which.
According to the manufacturer's website itself and the numerous tech review sites, it's the most compact Mini PC that doesn't sacrifice performance.
It also "is a small form factor PC with a tiny footprint". I assume this is what it means:

The pros of picking your own parts is that you get to choose The Good Stuff‚Ñ¢. 

I'm aware Infidel isn't faring very well in the Worldwide Transistor-Shrinkage Competition at the moment, but if random people on
the internet say this PC is good, it must be gospel!
The hardest part of this whole thing is the choosing.  For unknown reasons, someone up the corporate ladder at Infidel
decided to push out as many slightly different but ultimately very similar products, all with different product names that read
like randomly generated passwords.

With exemplary skills of deduction (by means of searching for Infidel NUCs on Amazon and picking the cheapest model), I deciphered
the optimal PC for my needs. 

I of course ordered the kit, as the rules dictate it must be so.
But with this you have to order the RAM and SSD separately.  If you're uncertain what to do here, you can read the specs on <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark.html#@Intel%C2%AENUC" target="_blank">the website.</a> 

## Setting it up
After I unscrewed the back to reveal the PC's inner workings and popped in the RAM and SSD, I plugged in all the necessary
bits and bobs including the ethernet cable and bootable thumb drive with Ubuntu Server on it.

I used a nifty program called <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" target="_blank">balenaEtcher</a> to turn my boring old thumb drive into a bootable one.

Lugging an old monitor and a dusty keyboard over, I was soon faced with issues regarding the monitor.  The NUC
doesn't come pre-installed with various drivers, so the USB-C cable I was using for my Mac to connect to the monitor didn't work very well.
I fetched a HDMI cable instead, and things were swell.
For the keyboard, the USB-A dongle worked fine plugged directly into the NUC.

With everything plugged in and working and ready to go, I turned on the monitor and began the setup process.
I was presented with the Infidel NUC logo, then the rather barebones setup screen.
Selecting BIOS Settings revealed more advanced NUC settings ranging from fan speed to boot options.

The setup process is relatively straightforward after selecting Install The Certain Operating System.
A waterfall of logs spews over your screen for a while, and you go through keyboard language selection.
I created the default user account and set the name for the NUC, which obviously had to be WALNUC.

To enable a wireless WiFi connection, I used nmcli, but I had to already be connected to the router
on setup beforehand to install the package (it doesn't come preinstalled with Ubuntu 20.04)

With it basically working I added my public SSH key to the server and SSH'd into it.

This method is similar to how I used to do it on DigitalOcean, but with a few more steps for port
forwarding.
